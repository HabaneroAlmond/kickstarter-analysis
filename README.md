# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns!
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
The purpose of this analysis was to help our friend Louise create more succesful Kickstarter campaigns for plays. She already had success with the Kickstarter for her play 'Fever' and now we can use our analyzed data of other similar Kickstarter campaigns to continue her success.
