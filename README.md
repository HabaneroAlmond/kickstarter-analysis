# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns!
# Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to help our friend Louise create more succesful Kickstarter campaigns for plays. She already had success with the Kickstarter for her play 'Fever' and now we can use our analyzed data of other similar Kickstarter campaigns to continue her success. 
# Analysis and Challenges
We used many different tools and formulas to analyze our data, and created graphs to help visualize our results. Firstly, we wanted to find out if the launch date of a Kickstarter had any impact on it being successful. We started by filtering our parent category to 'Theater'so that our data would be most relevant to Louise. Then we created a pivot chart organized with data from the month the theater Kickstarters were launched and the number of successful, failed, or canceled campaigns in those months. We then used our chart to create a line graph to help us easily visualize our data, as you can see below.

Now that we knew what effects the month you launch your theater Kickstarter might have, we wanted to find out how important the financial goal of a campaign was to the outcome. We split our data up into 12 different goal categories from <1000 to >50000 then used the COUNTIFS function in EXCEL to filter for three ranges from our Kickstarter data: Outcome, Goal, and Subcategory. The COUNTIFS function allowed us to apply specific criteria to these ranges, succesful, failed or canceled for the outcome range, the 12 different goal categories, and the Subcategory 'plays'. After organizing a very specific data set that was most relevant to Louise, we created a line graph to help us better communicate our results to the client.

This was no easy task, namely because of the large data set and the problems that can create with your formula syntax. When creating a pivot chart for the outcomes based on launch date excel would not let me group the data by months because I had unknowingly not applied the formula in the date created conversion column to all the cells. When I tried to group the column in my pivot chart nothing would happen, and for the 2009 year instead of dates i had roughly 50 cells of just random numbers. After fixing my date created conversion column it then allowed me to group by the month. The COUNTIFS function was confusing at first but after using it a few times I found it kind of exciting. I found out you can actually apply up to 127 criteria to a set of ranges with this formula which is insane. I found that I became most comfortable with it by writing out the formula code each time.
# Results
There are some easy conclusions we can come to from our analysis of the date you start a Kickstarter. Based on our data we found that the summer months give you the highest chance at having a succesful Kickstarter campaign, whereas the Winter/Holiday months, especially December, give you the lowest chances. As far as the outcomes based on goals analysis the one conclusion that seems probable is that the lower your campaign goal is the more likely it is for it to be succesful. Aside from that the data seems a bit all over the place, with a drop in success rate percentages in the $20'000-$35'000 ranges and then a seemingly random spike in $35000-$45000 range. I don't think we can draw a meaningful conclusion from that. This leads us to the limitations of this dataset in that it doesn't account for variance in the quality of the play being pitched by the Kickstarter. For example the spike in the $35000-$45000 goal range could be attributed to the playwrite, topic of the play, venue for the event, our fiscal goal data doesn't account for those variables. For a full report for Louise I would recommend a few more tables and graphs. It would be easier for Louise to visualize her data if we had a line graph comparing successful vs failed campaigns based on year, this would allow us to look at braoder trends in the Kickstarter play 'market'.
